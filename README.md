# Election_Analysis
***Overview*** <br /> 
Client Steve has enlisted our support in order to automate his analysis of stock market perfomance over a 2 year window to help inform his clients of wise choices for their stock options. The goal of this project was to develop efficient VBA code to automate the analysis for Steve so that he might be able to use the macros on any set of stock market data and arrive at his desired statistics quickly and accurately. Specifically, he wishes to compare the total daily volume and yearly return for 14 different stocks in such a way that he can analyze additional or fewer stocks in the future with the same macros. <br /> <br />
***Result*** <br /> 
The client asked that we specifically analyze the *Total Daily Volume* and the *Yearly Return* for each of the stocks listed below from 2017 to 2018. <br />

The project provided the following macros for client Steve. <br />

enabled him to run these specific analysis on any worksheet that is similarly formatted with any number of observed tickers
**Analysis** <br />
Overall, 2017 was a very good year for alternative energy producing companies, save for *TerraForm Power (TERP)*. In fact, the client's parents inverstment interest, *Daqo New Energy Corp (DQ)*, yielded the highest returns of any of the observed stocks nearly tripling. However, 2018 makes for a very different picture for renewable energy showing big losses for each of the monitored companies save for *Enphase Energy Inc. (ENPH)* and *Sunrun Inc. (RUN)* who gained nearly 82% and 84%, respectively.
